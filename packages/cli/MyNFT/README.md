# MyNFT Project

This project demonstrates a basic Foundry use case. It comes with a contract generated by OpenZeppelin Wizard, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

## Installing Foundry

See [Foundry installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

## Initializing the project

```
bash setup.sh
```

## Testing the contract

```
forge test
```

## Deploying the contract

You can simulate a deployment by running the script:

```
forge script script/MyNFT.s.sol
```

See [Solidity scripting guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/guides/scripting-with-solidity) for more information.
